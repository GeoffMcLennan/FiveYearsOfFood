  instructions: [
    'To prepare the chicken marinade, rough chop the lemongrass and add it to a food processor along with the peeled ginger and garlic.',
    'Pulse the aromatics until they make a relatively fine mixture but not quite a paste.',
    'To a large ziploc freezer bag, add the chicken thighs, aromatics, coconut milk, and fish sauce.',
    'Mix thoroughly and let the chicken marinade for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.',
    'For the pickled carrots, julienne the carrots using a mandolin if preferred.',
    'In a small sauce pot, combine the vinegar, water, salt, and sugar. Warm the mixture over medium heat until the salt and sugar dissolve but do not boil.',
    'Add the julienned carrots to a heat-proof vessel like a mason jar, and pour the warm pickling liquid over top.',
    'Allow the mixture to cool before storing in the fridge. The carrots can be used immediately or made up to a day in advance.',
    'To prepare the meal, prepare your rice by adding the rice, coconut milk, and enough water to your rice maker and cooking according to instructions.',
    'Add the oil to a high-sided heavy bottom pot. You will need about 2 inches of oil, which may be more or less than 2 litres depending on the size of your pot.',
    'Bring the oil to 375\u00b0F.',
    'While waiting for the oil to come to temperature, julienne the bell pepper and cucumber and rough chop the cilantro.',
    'Once the oil is heated, add your flour to a wide shallow plate or bowl for dredging.',
    'To fry the chicken, pull a piece of chicken from the marinade, allowing the bulk of the marinade to drain off but keeping a layer on the chicken.',
    'Drop the chicken on the dredging flour. Flip and press the flour onto the surface of the chicken, ensuring the entire surface is coated with flour.',
    'Carefully drop the chicken into the fry oil, making sure to lay it away from yourself to avoid splashing. Cook in batches of 2-3 chicken thighs depending on the size of your pan.',
    'Let the chicken fry for 5-8 minutes until it reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F. Pull the chicken onto a wire rack, and immediately season with salt.',
    'For plating, add a portion of rice to a plate or bowl. Top with the pickled carrot, cucumber, and pepper. Add 1-2 pieces of chicken and finish with some fresh cilantro and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.'
