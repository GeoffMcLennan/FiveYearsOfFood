  story: 'This pasta is perfect for camping trips! Easily made in one pot, and you can add whatever vegetables/meats you can find to the sauce (in the case of Nelson\'s ballin\' grocer, this was olives and pancetta). This pairs well with a growler fill from the nearest brewery, and with a campsite nestled into the city of Nelson.',
